# hello-world
This is my first repository. In a month I will feel super comfortable here, right now I feel like I'm taking the Polar Bear plunge nekkid on New Years Day. 
I'm just a small town girl. I am living in a lonely world. I'm thinking of taking a south bound train to anywhere...

Welp it's been a few years and github is still a mystery to me. I'm learning python now and working hard to change career paths again. Building momentum.
